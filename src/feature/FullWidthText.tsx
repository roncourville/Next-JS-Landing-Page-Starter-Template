        The Pathways Study closely follows a diverse cohort of 4,505 women
        diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between the years 2006 and 2013.
        With repeated participant contacts, access to electronic health records,
        bio-specimen collection and genetic array sequencing, this study has
        accumulated a trove important information with the primary purpose of
        determining how lifestyle and genetic factors impact the breast cancer
